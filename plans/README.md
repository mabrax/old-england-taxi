# Rollout Plans

Each stage brief defines one bounded stage. Stages that benefit from incremental delivery keep their overview and phase briefs in a slugged subfolder. Each phase's implementation plan is discussed with the user and detailed only when that phase is ready to begin; writing a brief does not authorize implementation.

1. [00 — Project setup](./00-project-setup.md)
2. [01 — Zone compiler](./zone-compiler/README.md)
3. [02 — Parameterized Zone Generation](./parameterized-zone-generation/README.md)
4. [03 — Driveability](./driveability/README.md)
5. [04 — Zone selection and continuity](./03-zone-generalization.md)
6. [05 — Geographic fidelity](./04-geographic-fidelity.md)
7. [06 — Training experience](./05-training-experience.md)

Stages are tackled in order. A stage starts only after the previous exit condition is met, and its phases are tackled in order unless the stage brief explicitly says otherwise.

Zone Compiler and Driveability keep their complete stage briefs in their subfolders. Remaining later-stage filenames stay stable for links; their headings and ordering reflect the promoted stage.

Stages 01–02 and the user-requested [on-demand location generation extension](./on-demand-generation.md) are complete. The extension adds delivered browser place-name/coordinate input, bounded localhost generation through a separate worker, and persistent verified cache/catalogue reuse. Earlier completion records retain their original scope and verification evidence; their geocoding/on-demand exclusions describe those stages, not missing current capabilities.

Stage 03 has completed its authorized Phase 01 physical world and Phase 02 first vehicle implementations. Phases 03–04 (interaction and qualification) remain unstarted; Stage 03 is not complete. Stage 04 retains map selection, richer cache policy, and adjacency/continuity. Hosted multi-user generation remains a separate decision. Physical driveability does not certify legal routes or all graph-connected streets; routing semantics and qualification remain a dependency to resolve before Stage 06 training.
